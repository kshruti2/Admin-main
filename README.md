This project is an Admin Dashboard that enables efficient user management with role-based access control (RBAC). The dashboard allows administrators to manage user accounts, view statistics, and access data visualizations. It includes two roles: Admin and User, each with specific permissions. The interface is fully responsive, ensuring usability across desktop and mobile devices.
